I'm currently learning shell scripting and I know how difficult it is to change directories via the terminal. So I thought about coding an automated and interactive shell script. Thus, the user only needs to enter the folder and name files to navigate between directories. To control, the code is running in a "while loop" until the user stop and the user needs to enter a number listed in the options. Choosing a number, the script will execute the code necessary for the action.

#### Status do Projeto

**🚀 Finalizado**

## prerequisites

To execute this code it's necessary have a linux operating system, because the code into it was created to work with zsh. So if your OS is other, try to create a virtual machine. if your system is Linux, continue following the steps below:


When done, you will need to enable the run option for file.sh:

```bash
  chmod +r operable-paths.sh
```

If you want to change the code, it's necessary use a code editor of your preference. I recommend use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
